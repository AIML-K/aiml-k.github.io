Concordia Contest, organized by the Cooperative AI Foundation and Google Deepmind, focuses on enhancing the cooperative intelligence of modern AI agents. It presents a variety of scenarios in which agents must engage in cooperative behavior to attain high returns.

197 participants submitted 878 submissions during the development phase, and 25 agents competed in the final phase. Taehun's agent takes an action considering two arguments: (1) expected reward of the action and (2) common ground between agents. As a result, it succeeded in achieving high utility while maintaining a cooperative stance.
