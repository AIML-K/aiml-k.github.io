Wanshan Cui now holds M.S. in Financial Engineering degree. Her M.S. thesis, titled "Enhancing Stock Price Forecasting with Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis Using Bilingual Financial News and Time-Series Data", explores the impact of cross-cultural financial news on stock price pre-diction by leveraging both traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). 

Congratulations, Wanshan, on earning your M.S. in Financial Engineering! Watching your growth—intellectually and personally—has been one of the true joys of my role as your advisor. You’ve tackled tough problems in Project Epoxy with creativity and depth, always willing to dig deeper, ask harder questions, and push yourself beyond the comfortable. Your work has been thoughtful and often surprising (in the best way). As you step into your next adventure, bring that same brilliance, curiosity, and heart to everything you do in future.

Chang-Hae Jung now holds M.S. in Mathematics degree. His M.S. capstone project, titled "Large Language Model and Recommender System", showcases how he implemented an LLM-powered personalized research paper recommender system that linked ArXiv, Notion, and Zotero, using no-code pipelining methods offered by MAKE.

Congratulations, Chang-Hae, on earning your M.S. in Mathematics degree. You brought so much to AIML@K - not just through your solid technical work and thoughtful approach to research, but also through your steady presence and good humor. You’ve contributed to many projects, handled hard missions when they mattered, and helped raise the bar for all of us. I have no doubt you’ll continue to excel, not just because you’re talented but also because you’re genuine and reliable. Keep exploring, questioning, and above all, keep being yourself.
