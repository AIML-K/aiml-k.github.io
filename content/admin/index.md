I am Jonghyun Kim, an undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematics at Korea University.

My academic interests lie in stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and natural language processing (NLP). I am particularly interested in the mathematical foundations of language models and stochastic analysis techniques for modeling uncertainty in natural systems.

I hope to build research experience that bridges rigorous mathematical theory with applied machine learning techniques, especially in generative models and dynamical systems.
