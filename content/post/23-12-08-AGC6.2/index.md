CONGRATULATIONS to all participants of team 'aimlk', for securing the seventh place at the 6th AI Grand Challenge, Stage 2! 

<!--more-->

The second stage of the 6th AI Grand Challenge '정책 지원 AI', took a sharp turn from document retrieval and evidence closed-domain QA with reasoning to automated report generation with closed domain corpus QA. 
Once again hosted by Ministry of Science and ICT (과학기술정보통신부) of South Korea, this competition invited the first stage winners and top three teams from the Open Track competition. 
To our surprise, our team 'aimlk' ranked seventh place, once again demonstrating the capacity of mathematics graduate students in developing actual AI applications.
