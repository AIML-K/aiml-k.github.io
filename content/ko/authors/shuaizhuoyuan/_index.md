<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
I am a master’s student in t  he Department of Mathematics (MDS) . To date, participation is made in the Journal Club sessions regarding Bayesian optimization in AIML.

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
Recently, I have focused on research into GflowNet, an interesting network proposed by Yoshua Bengio's team, able to generate various candidates with high quality based on reward functions. Its applications span from molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization, causal discovery, and Bayesian inference, among many others.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
Before coming to Korea, I had already gained 3 years of working experience in logistics scheduling with the Inditex Group but was affected by COVID-19, which made me reconsider the direction and possibilities of my future.
