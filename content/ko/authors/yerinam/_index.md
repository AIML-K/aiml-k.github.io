<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
I'm Yeri Nam, a System Software Engineer at HP. After graduating from Ewha Womans University in 2019, I joined HP following an internship where I developed a Gradient Boost Decision Tree model to predict adoption speed based on animal profiles, including text and images. Since then, I've specialized in image quality evaluation and document processing algorithms for printer devices.
Currently, I'm pursuing graduate studies as an M.S. student at Korea University. My research interests include embedding and reasoning in large language models. I'm fluent in both C and Python, and I thrive on solving complex problems through collaboration and customer-focused design.
I've also led volunteer initiatives like Hour of Code, inspiring young students to explore coding. My international experience as an exchange student in California has broadened my perspective and strengthened my adaptability.
