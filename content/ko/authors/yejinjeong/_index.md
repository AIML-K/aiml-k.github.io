<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
Hello! I am a Master’s student in Mathematical Data Science at Korea University and currently part of the AIML@K lab, where I’m exploring various research fields.

My current research interest is medical image processing. I became interested in this area during an internship that was part of my MDS program, where I worked on developing a clinical decision support system for diagnosing patient conditions.

I’m also fascinated by Bayesian optimization and have been studying it consistently. I enjoy learning a broad range of topics without limiting myself to a single area, aiming to expand my interdisciplinary perspective through continuous exploration.
