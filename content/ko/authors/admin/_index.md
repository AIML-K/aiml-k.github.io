<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
현재 고려대학교 이과대학 수학과에서 부교수로 봉직중이며, 고려대학교 정보대학 데이터과학과에 겸임으로 소속되어 있습니다. 
2020년도부터 AIML@K 연구실을 이끌고 있으며, 인공지능과 수학의 중요성을 직시하며 미래사회를 이끌어갈 연구자이자 리더들을 길러내고 있습니다. 

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
My personal research themes include learning to make wise decisions under uncertainty, efficiency of machine learning algorithms, explainable and verifiable artificial intelligence. 
I believe that research with solid ties to real applications and practical impact is as important as research in abstract setting that maximizes generalizability.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
My Ph.D. started in 2009 and ended in 2019: in the midst of my Ph.D. decade I also worked as a (senior) software engineer at Samsung Electronics. Meanwhile, I have been putting efforts into public outreaches regarding significant events and impactful findings in my field of research and interest, such as "Dissecting AlphaGo" (알파고 해부하기) series. 
Additional details can be found in my [curriculum vitae](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZI5EFBZ3Xsw4TMAHOI6sB7T_JsBC7y4UUIAGhU-sXo/edit?usp=sharing).
