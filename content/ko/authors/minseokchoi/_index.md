<!-- 자기소개 등등 -->

I am visiting Korea University from February 20, 2025 to February 20, 2026, hosted by [Prof. Donghun Lee](https://aiml-k.github.io/author/donghun-lee/) in Department of Mathematics. 
We are collaborating on cutting-edge theory and real world applications of scientific machine learning methods such as PINN and Operator Learning. 
My background on studying PINN and related mathematical fields during my Ph.D. program under supervision of [Prof. George Karniadakis](https://engineering.brown.edu/people/george-e-karniadakis) will contribute significantly on the collaboration during my visit to AIML@K.

Please visit [my academic website](https://sites.google.com/view/choiminseok) for more details and updates.
