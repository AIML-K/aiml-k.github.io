abstract: 'In information retrieval, traditional models like TF-IDF and BM25 have been used for search engine
queries. However, with the rise of deep learning in natural language processing, DPR-BERT has
significantly improved accuracy in this field. However, DPR-BERT has limitations related to precise
retrieval concerning perspectives. In this paper, to address these limitations, we propose a new
architecture that extracts perspective and incorporates them into the retrieval process. In this
process, experiments were conducted by modifying the method of obtaining similarity and the
training objective function defined by the original DPR to align with our goals. Our experimental
results confirm that incorporating perspective during retrieval significantly improves the process
compared to not doing so.'
