abstract: We introduce a new type of problems for math word problem (MWP) solvers,
  named Noun-MWPs, whose answer is a non-numerical string containing a noun from the
  problem text. We present a novel method to empower existing MWP solvers to handle
  Noun-MWPs, and apply the method on Expression-Pointer Transformer (EPT). Our model,
  N-EPT, solves Noun-MWPs significantly better than other models, and at the same
  time, solves conventional MWPs as well. Solving Noun-MWPs may lead to bridging MWP
  solvers and traditional question-answering NLP models.
