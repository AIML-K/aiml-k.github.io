<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
My name is Dayeon Shin, and I am a master’s student in the Department of Mathematics (MDS) at Korea University and researching artificial intelligence at AIML@K.

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
I'm interested in leveraging mathematics to enhance the reliability of AI models and agent architecture to improve work efficiency. I have experience developing a LangGraph-based automated teaching assistant chatbot and have conducted research on spatial audio generation.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
AAfter graduating from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies with a degree in Environmental Studies, I worked as a math instructor at a private academy for two and a half years. Then, driven by a passion for mathematics and AI, I enrolled in Korea University's Department of Mathematics. I hope to apply AI to various domains to make the world a better place.
