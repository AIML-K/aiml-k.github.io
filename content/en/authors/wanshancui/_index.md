<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
I am a master’s student in Financial Engineering at Korea University and expect to graduate in February 2025. I have participated in the epoxy project at AIML, where my primary role involved developing predictive models for material properties and using outlier detection techniques to enhance prediction reliability.

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
My research interest lies in quantitative trading using machine learning, focusing on utilizing LLMs for alpha generation. I am exploring alpha signal extraction from diverse financial data sources using state-of-the-art NLP technologies, specifically focusing on how LLMs can identify novel trading signals and improve investment strategies. 

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
Before entering graduate school, I accumulated approximately eight years of experience in business management at Samsung Electronics. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted me to reconsider my career path and pursue advanced studies in financial engineering. I am dedicated to learning and applying AI techniques to contribute to quantitative finance.
