<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
I am an associate professor in [Department of Mathematics](https://math.korea.ac.kr/), [College of Science](https://science.korea.ac.kr/science/index.do), Korea University. 
I am also jointed appointed by [Department of Data Science](https://datascience.korea.ac.kr/ds/index.do), [College of Informatics](https://info.korea.ac.kr/info/index.do), Korea University.
I have been leading AIML@K since 2021, with the goal of educating future leaders and colleagues aware of the importance of bridging artificial intelligence and mathematics.

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
My personal research themes since Ph.D. days include learning to make wise decisions under uncertainty, efficiency of machine learning algorithms, explainable and verifiable artificial intelligence. 
I believe that research with solid ties to real applications and practical impact is as important as research in abstract setting that maximizes generalizability. 
I thank [Professor Warren B. Powell](https://castle.princeton.edu/people/), my Ph.D. advisor, for nudging me toward this full-spectrum, end-to-end research-to-reality attitude. 

As a faculty in Math department, I am keenly interested in the future of mathematics. 
Perhaps we are living in the groundbreaking days of mathematics which may be recollected in future as the second paradigm-shift of mathematic (perhaps, Bourbaki 2.0?).
My current research thrust includes novel synthesis of mathematics research with computational tools, such as computer-assisted theorem proving and multimodal generative models.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
## Trivia
- My Ph.D. started in 2009 and ended in 2019: in the midst of my Ph.D. decade I also worked as a (senior) software engineer at [Samsung Electronics](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/about-us/business-area/memory/).
- I am interested in public outreaches regarding significant events and impactful findings in my field of research and interest, such as "Dissecting AlphaGo" (알파고 해부하기) series. 
- There is another professor with exactly same name in Physics Department of Korea University. Our mails, preprints, and publications tend to get mixed up by both humans and computers. What can I do?
