<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
I am a master's student in the Department of Mathematics at Korea University. I joined AIML@K in the fall of 2025.

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
I began studying artificial intelligence with the goal of contributing to the creation of systems more intelligent than humans.
My current research focuses on developing AI systems capable of logical reasoning, particularly mathematical reasoning.
I am also conducting research on Autoformalization and Automated Theorem Proving systems, as part of my broader interest in advancing mathematics through artificial intelligence.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
Since my undergraduate years, I have enjoyed solving and designing programming problems that combine mathematical ideas with algorithmic thinking.
This experience has broadened my interests to include computer algorithms, computational algebra, and related areas.
