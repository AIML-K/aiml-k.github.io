I am an artificial intelligence enthusiast upon mathematical background and practical experiences in computer.
I still believe in that there’s a lot to learn in both mathematics and computers science to make AI reach further to the future and closer to our everyday lives.

I started my academic journey at Korea University, and graduated in Spring 2024.
During which I had multiple experiences in various modalities, including computer vision, natural language, and a slight edge of voice.
Moreover, I finished my thesis about accelerating diffusion generative model based on fundamental policy gradient algorithm.

Currently, I’m working as an AI engineer in medical vision field, and looking forward to keep on this track along with my unique identity whereby I have experienced in multiple modalities.
