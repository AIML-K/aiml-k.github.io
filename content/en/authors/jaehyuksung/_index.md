<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
My objective is to use the computer science knowledge (especially basic machine learning and deep learn- ing) and mathematical knowledge (statistics, optimization theory, theoretical machine (deep) learning theory) that I have accumulated during my undergraduate studies to do the NLP research that I have always wanted to do. 

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
I am interested in researching mathematical problem-solving models and wish to passionately carry out my desired research based on the latest trends identified through my undergraduate studies and paper reviews.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
I learned a lot and had a great time being an undergraduate researcher in AIML@K.
