I am a Ph.D cantidate in Department of Mathematics, Korea University. As a senior member of AIMLK, I managed multiple projects on NLP, computer vision, signal processing, etc. For my personal research, I'm working on training algorithm called bypassing, and related applications including structured pruning for neural networks.

I like to create something novel and useful, and thus I characterize myself an inventor. Before entering the graduate school, I was working on start-up projects with my invention, the flat light collecting device and blind clutches. After, I started to invent mathematical proofs as a graduate student, major in algebraic geometry for the first two years and finally joined to AIMLK as a starting member to make AI-methods with my mathematical skills.

As a mathematics majored researcher, I am looking for methods with rigorous mathematical explanations for various subdomains of AI. Especially geometric methods and reparameterization methods are in my interest.
