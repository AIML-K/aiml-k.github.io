<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
I am a Master's student currently completing my degree program. My research focuses on quantitative equity market analysis, specifically on identifying market discrepancies using both qualitative and quantitative approaches.

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
My personal research interests include outlier detection within the context of time series analysis and artificial intelligence.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
Before pursuing my Master's degree, I earned a Bachelor's degree from Korea University between 2016 and 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on Linear Algebra, proving the existence of an inverse matrix under specific conditions, and explored the winning strategy for the game of Rummikub using combinatorial analysis.
