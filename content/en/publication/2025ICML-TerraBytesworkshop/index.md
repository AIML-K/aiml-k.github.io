abstract: "Observation in Earth sciences encompasses not only what can be visually perceived but also what can be inferred through instrumental recordings. As such, seismic data, though not directly visible, fall within the domain of Earth Observation (EO). Earthquakes are inherently sparse events, and the limited availability of ground motion records and associated metadata poses significant challenges for predicting and responding to earthquake-induced hazards. Although numerous data augmentation techniques based on deep learning have been proposed, their effectiveness is often hindered by the scarcity of high-quality training data. We introduce a scalable framework for constructing training datasets from limited seismic observations, aimed at improving the performance of generative models. By training models on the paired dataset constructed using our proposed methodology, we demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that the generated waveforms closely resemble real seismic signals, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'This work presents a scalable framework to generate high-quality training datasets from sparse seismic observations and an accompanying dataset from publicly available seismographic data source, enabling deep generative models to produce realistic earthquake waveforms despite limited data.'
