ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ **AIML@K members are presenting one main track paper and four workshop papers in ICML 2025! Congratulations!**

<!--more-->

[Broadband Ground Motion Synthesis by Diffusion Model with Minimal Condition](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025icml-jung-lee-jung-kim-jung-lee/) presents a professional-level generative model for earthquake shockwave synthesis. This work is going to be presented as a main-track poster, between 11AM and 1:30PM PDT on July 16, 2025.

[Catalyst: Structured Pruning with Robust Bifurcation Dynamics](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025icml-hildworkshop-catalyst/) proposes a mathematically principled structured pruning regularizer with provable bifurcation dynamics. This work is going to be presented in 3rd Workshop on High-dimensional Learning Dynamics (HiLD) at ICML 2025.

[Emergent Linear Separability of Unseen Data Points in High-dimensional Last-Layer Feature Space](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025icml-hildworkshop-linsep/) reports an emergent linearity in last layer feature space of neural networks. This work is also going to be presented in 3rd Workshop on High-dimensional Learning Dynamics (HiLD) at ICML 2025.

[Enhancing Generative Seismic Modeling via Proposed Paired Dataset Construction Method](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025icml-terrabytesworkshop/) presents how public seismological waveform data can be turned into a novel set of earth observation data. This work is going to be presented in TerraBytes Workshop at ICML 2025.

[Broadband Ground Motion Synthesis by Diffusion Model with Minimal Condition](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025icml-ml4audioworkshop/) emphasizes the waveform generative model element of the same titled ICML 2025 main track paper, which bested state-of-the-art time series generative models. This work is going to be presented in ICML 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning for Audio.
