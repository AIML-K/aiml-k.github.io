[OPC: One-Point-Contraction Unlearning Toward Deep Feature Forgetting](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025iccv-unmeworkshop-opc/) presents a new machine unlearning algorithm that enforces deep feature forgetting by contracting representations of data to be forgotten, achieving stronger resistance to recovery and gradient-inversion attacks than existing unlearning methods. 

[IPPRO: Importance-based Pruning with PRojective Offset for Magnitude-indifferent Structural Pruning](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025iccv-unmeworkshop-ippro/) introduces a novel magnitude-indifferent structured pruning method, named IPPRO, which embeds filters into a projective space and defines a new importance score (PROscore) based on gradient movement, enabling loss-minimal pruning beyond the "size matters" convention.
