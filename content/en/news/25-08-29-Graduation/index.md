Nayoung Lee now holds M.S. in Mathematics degree. 
Her capstone project, titled "Graph Foundation Model in Real-World
Travel Recommendation Systems" is a solid example of how an internship project can grow into a full-fledged research project with impact in real world. 
We’re saying a heartfelt farewell to Nayoung Lee, whose curiosity and dedication have made such a meaningful impact on everyone she’s worked with. 
During her stay in Mathematical Data Science program at Korea University, Nayoung has built an inspiring path at the intersection of data and artificial intelligence. 
Her work on large language models and graph-based recommendation systems has reflected both technical excellence and genuine passion for discovery. 
We’re so grateful for the time, energy, and heart she’s shared with us — and we can’t wait to see where her journey leads next. Wishing her every success and happiness in all that’s ahead.

Although it’s bittersweet to see you move on, this farewell is just a waypoint, not an end. 
You leave behind work that will continue to resonate, questions that will draw new inquiries, and a spirit of curiosity that will inspire others. 
May your next steps bring fresh insights, bold discoveries, and meaningful connections. 
Thank you, Nayoung — here’s to the many brilliant things still to come.

Yejin Jeong now holds M.S. in Mathematics degree. Her capstone project, titled "CLIP-KOA: Enhancing Knee Osteoarthritis 
Diagnosis with Multi-Modal Learning and Symmetry-Aware Loss Functions" is a culmination of her internship at CONNECTEVE Inc. and research projects in MDS program of Korea University, finally presented at MICCAI 2025 workshop.
We’d like to extend our heartfelt gratitude and best wishes to Yejin Jeong, whose curiosity and dedication have touched so many in our lab. 
As a Master’s student in Mathematical Data Science at Korea University, Yejin has brought energy and insight into medical image processing and novel material discovery in chemical engineering. 
Her experience working on clinical decision support systems and her eagerness to explore broadly across different topics has enriched our conversations and work alike. 
Beyond her research contributions, Yejin’s warmth and collaborative spirit have made her a cherished presence with us. 
We deeply appreciate the time, passion, and fresh perspectives she’s shared. 
Though we’ll miss her, we’re excited for all the great things she’ll do next — and we’ll always be cheering her on.

It’s hard to put into words just how much you’ve meant to all of us. 
Your time here has been filled with quiet strength, warmth, and genuine curiosity — the kind that makes everyone around you feel inspired to think a little deeper and care a little more. You’ve approached every projec with patience, humility, and a true spirit of learning.
Beyond the research, what we’ll remember most is you — your kindness, your laughter, and the way you brought calm focus and optimism to the group, even during challenging times. 
You’ve left a mark not only through your work but through the relationships and trust you built here. 
Thank you for being such a thoughtful teammate and a wonderful human being. 
We’ll miss you deeply, and we’re all cheering you on as you move toward new adventures.
