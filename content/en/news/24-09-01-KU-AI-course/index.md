We are proud to announce that four AIML@K students are selected in the inaugural recruitment of highly skilled teaching assistants (TAs) for Korea University’s first university-wide course on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Selected through a rigorous university-wide recruitment process, these TAs are integral to the launch and success of this pioneering course.

The course, titled “Data Science and Artificial Intelligence” (데이터과학과 인공지능) with the course code GECT003, has become a mandatory part of the core curriculum for all first-year students at Korea University, starting from 2024. This course marks a significant step in equipping students across all disciplines with essential skills in data science and AI, regardless of their chosen major.

Given that this is the first offering of the course, our TAs are playing a crucial role not only in fulfilling their regular responsibilities but also in adapting to challenges and making real-time improvements as needed. Their dedication and adaptability are commendable, and they have been instrumental in ensuring a smooth and successful launch.

We extend our deepest appreciation to all the TAs for their hard work and commitment to this ambitious new initiative!
