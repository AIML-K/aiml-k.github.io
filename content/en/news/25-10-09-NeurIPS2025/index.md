[Best of Both Worlds: Bridging Laplace and Fourier for Generalizable and Efficient Operator Learning](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025neurips-ml4psworkshop/) presents Laplaceâ€“Fourier Neural Operator (LFNO) that combines Laplace and Fourier operator ideas to model both transient and steady-state system dynamics, demonstrating superior generalization and efficiency on ODE/PDE tasks like the Duffing equation and Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam.

[Feature Learning as a Virtual Covariance Learning](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025neurips-optworkshop/) connects feature learning and SGD by interpreting "virtual updates" on hidden states, enabling direct weight construction aligned with covariance structureâ€”achieving effective learning in 1â€“2 epochs vs. the typical 10â€“20. 

[Bridging data-rich and data-poor domains on Lithium-Ion Battery via Scanning Electron Microscopic data through Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025neurips-ai4matworkshop/) presents a two-stage transfer learning approach that enables accurate lithium-ion battery SEM image classification across domain shifts, achieving over 0.98 accuracy with limited data.

[Numbers Already Carry Their Own Embeddings](https://aiml-k.github.io/publication/2025neurips-mathaiworkshop/) constructs Adelic Operation-preserved Embeddings (AOE), a training-free representation for numbers such that the embeddings preserve more operational properties than widely used tokenization methods, resulting in much improved AI4Math prediction task performances.
