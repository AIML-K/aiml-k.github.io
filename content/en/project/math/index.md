## Intro

Mathematics has long been regarded as the most precise and rigorous of the sciences, founded on logical deduction and proof. Yet the tools and methods by which mathematicians explore, conjecture, and verify results are undergoing a profound transformation. With the advent of powerful computational methods and artificial intelligence (AI), mathematical research is increasingly moving from traditional pencil-and-paper reasoning to collaborative humanâ€“machine discovery.
This research project investigates the emerging synthesis between mathematics, computation, and AI, with extra focus on the following thrusts:
- The growing role of computation in exploring mathematical spaces.
- The automation of proof verification and generation.
- The implications of AI systems that can conjecture, reason, and explain.
