summary: How to merge the goodness of Laplace Neural Operator and Fourier Neural Operator?
abstract: |
  We introduce Laplace–Fourier Neural Operator (LFNO), a novel operator learning model that bridges the strengths of Laplace Neural Operators (LNO) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). By combining the transient response of LNO with the steady-state response of FNO through the Fourier integral operator, our model enables capturing transient behavior more effectively than both LNO and FNO while remaining comparable on linear and nonlinear PDEs. We demonstrate LFNO's effectiveness on solving three ODEs (Duffing, Lorenz, Pendulum) and five PDEs (Euler-Bernoulli beam, diffusion, reaction-diffusion, Brusselator, Gray-Scott) in comparison to FNO and LNO. These results highlight LFNO’s ability to unify transient and steady-state modeling, delivering superior accuracy and stability across various dynamical systems.

We are excited to see this talk! It is first event for AIML@K students to give a talk at KIAS.

<!-- 
Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
