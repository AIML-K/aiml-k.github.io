<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
I am an M.S Student in Department of Mathematics, Korea University. Additionally, I completed my degree at the Department of Mathematics at K.U., as well as my education at K.U. High School and K.U. Middle School.

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
My research interests lie in enhancing Language Models for mathematical problem-solving. Additionally, I have interest in analyzing optimizers using fractional derivatives, applying them in Gradient Descent and Neural Network. However, I don't want to restrict my interest to just some subjects.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
In 2022, I augmented Raman spectra using VAE and GAN. In 2023, I developed an algorithm to hedge IRS products. In 2024, I am participating in a competition to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence.
