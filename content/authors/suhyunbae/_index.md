Hi! My name is SuHyun, a Master student in Mathematical Data Science, Korea University since 2024. I'm interested in how to make models truthful. Not just LLMs like ChatGPT, but also any foundation models.
 
Talking about my hobby, I played piano since 2013, and was in college band club as keyboardist. I also like to play drums.
