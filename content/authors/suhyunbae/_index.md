<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
Hi, my name is SuHyun Bae. I'm Master student in Mathematical Data Science at Korea University. Also a researcher of AIML@K.
<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
My research interests are mainly in NLP and utilizing Language models.
<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
I have been interested in creating friendly AI since I was young. So I decided to study mathematics to understand the mathematical principles underlying AI. My goal is to analyze and design models rigorously.
