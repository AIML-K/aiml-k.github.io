<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
My name is Roh Kyunghee, and I am a master's student in the Department of Mathematics (MDS) at Korea University and researching artificial intelligence at AIML@K. 


<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
I'm interested in optimization and computer vision


<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
I graduated from the Department of Physics at Konkuk University. After studying Quantum Mechanics, I realized that physics was not my path.

### Research Experience

- 2023.08 - 2024.02 | Jump Rope  
  I developed an ML classification model for single/double jump rope using time-series sensor data

- 2024.03 - 06 | Autonomous Driving  
  I published a paper in KCC that analyzes the I/O data of AI algorithms for autonomous vehicles and proposes improvements to the storage system for each model

- 2024.08 - 09 | Semiconductor Processing  
  In the Samsung AI Challenge, I tackled a model-based optimization challenge aimed at determining the optimal parameters for semiconductor processing

- 2024.09 - 11 | Bayesian Optimization  
  Through our lab's journal club, I engaged in in-depth study of Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian Process, and Knowledge Gradient

- 2025.01 - present | AI Health Trainer  
  As an intern, I'm working on creating an AI fitness application to recognize human motion, count repetitions, and identify speed variations

### Research Focus

My current research focus involves extracting keypoint coordinates from video frames of exercise movements, such as squats, barbell lifts, and overhead presses. I am utilizing the Temporal Shift Module (TSM) to detect speed changes in these movements. I am conducting experiments with various backbone models, including MobileNetV2, ResNet50, ResNet101, HRNetw32, and HRNetw48, to design a model that minimizes latency and maintains performance for real-time operation on mobile devices. A key aspect of my research is finding the optimal backbone model that balances PCKh and latency, while also investigating methods to enhance overall performance

### Research Goal

Our backbone model MobileNet V2 demonstrates a PCKh of 86.278 and a latency of 34.5ms when tested on a Galaxy Note 8. The objective of this research is to improve the AI model used for analyzing exercise motions to achieve a PCKh of 90 or more and reduce latency to under 30ms

To ensure practical application, I will evaluate the model's performance and usability in real-world scenarios, incorporating user feedback for continuous refinement. Additionally, I intend to expand the exercise motion dataset, developing a model robust to the inherent variability of real-world data. Finally, I am committed to the goal of releasing the developed AI fitness application in October
