<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
My name is Roh Kyunghee, and I am a master's student in the Department of Mathematics (MDS) at Korea University and researching artificial intelligence at AIML@K. 


<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
I'm interested in optimization and model compression. 


<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
I graduated from the Department of Physics at Konkuk University. After studying quantum mechanics, I realized that physics was not my path.
