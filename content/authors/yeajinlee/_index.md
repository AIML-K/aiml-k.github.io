<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
My name is Yeajin Lee and I have been a Master student in Finance Engineering at Korea University since 2024.



<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
I’m interested in Finance AI and MLP, and especially the convergence of these two fields. In addition, I would like to experience various areas of AI applications.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
I took a double undergraduate degree in Economics and AI Convergence (Business&AI) at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. I have experienced the connection between economics or business and AI, and I’m trying to do so on and on.
My CV is here: [PDF link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10-f0w9d58vrs85_dw_p_P5Aw5PaSWT0v/view?usp=sharing).
