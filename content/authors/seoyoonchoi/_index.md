<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics, with a strong interest in Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis and Healthcare Data Analysis. I have built a solid foundation in mathematics, statistics and theoretical machine learning, and I am mostly interested in applying these concepts to developing mathematical models for real-life problem-solving.

My research interests include exploring effective learning algorithms for time series forecasting and healthcare data analysis. I am studying mathematical modeling techniques to improve predictions and decision-making in medical diagnostics. I am actively gaining hands-on experience in implementing machine learning algorithms and analyzing their theoretical properties.

By combining my mathematical background with machine learning techniques, I hope to contribute to developing models capable of solving complex tasks in time series prediction and medical data analysis.
